# Description
The NBA history API is a collection of historical/trivia facts about the 30 NBA teams. The project is still in its early stages and the database of facts will potentially keep evolving. The goal is to eventually have people from the open source community contribute to the API by providing code patches as well as contributing historical/unique facts to the database.
